# PYTHON DEVELOPMENT

### 1. Test Driven Development

- Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative development cycle that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual feature or function.  
- TDD usually follows the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:
  1. Add a test to the test suite
  2. (Red) Run all the tests to ensure the new test fails.
  3. (Green) Write just enough code to get that single test to pass. Run all tests.
  4. (Refactor) Improve the initial code while keeping the tests green Repeat.
