|----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Understanding Unit Testing          | Learn what unit testing is, why it's important, and how it fits into the software development lifecycle. Focus on the basics of testing concepts like assertions and test cases.  |
| 2        | Setting Up Your Environment         | Learn to set up a testing environment using Python’s `unittest` framework and Flask's test client. Understand how to configure Flask for testing (e.g., using test databases).  |
| 3        | Writing Basic Test Cases            | Start by writing simple tests to understand the structure and syntax. Test Flask routes, templates, and context processors.                                                   |
| 4        | Using Mocks and Patches             | Learn how to use `unittest.mock` to isolate your tests from external systems and services. Understand how to mock database calls, external APIs, and internal application logic. |
| 5        | Flask Testing Tools                 | Explore Flask-specific testing tools like the application and request contexts, Flask’s test client, and how to use `flask-testing` extensions.                               |
| 6        | Testing Database Interactions       | Understand how to test database interactions effectively. Learn to use fixtures for database setup and teardown. Explore how to test SQLAlchemy models in a Flask application.  |
| 7        | Advanced Topics                     | Delve into more complex scenarios like testing AJAX calls, form validation, authentication, and session management.                                                          |
| 8        | Integration vs. Unit Testing        | Understand the difference between unit tests and integration tests. Learn when to use each type and how to write integration tests in a Flask context.                         |
| 9        | Continuous Integration              | Learn about Continuous Integration (CI) and how to integrate your Flask tests into a CI pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.                      |
| 10       | Best Practices and Common Pitfalls  | Learn best practices for writing effective tests and common pitfalls to avoid in Flask testing. Understand how to refactor tests and maintain test quality over time.          |
